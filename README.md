# curvylines
Curvy Lines demo in C++

Doesn't really do much other than let you draw two lines on screen, 
and then it interpolates a bunch of lines between them, making a pretty design.

This is the C++ version of code I originally wrote in BASIC on the Atari 800, and again in Java (1.2?) in like...1996?
